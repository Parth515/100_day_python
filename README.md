# 🐍 100 Days of Python: A Side Quest

This is my personal challenge to consistently improve my Python skills — not just by completing tasks but by dedicating time each day to learning, coding, and building.

## 💡 What's Different About My Challenge?

Instead of following a strict “1 topic per day” rule, I group tasks based on learning chunks and work through as much as I can depending on how much time I have. Some days I do multiple topics, others I go deep into one.

- 🧠 The goal is *daily coding*, not just finishing tasks.
- ✅ I track real progress, not artificial deadlines.

## 🗓️ Progress Philosophy

> *Consistency beats perfection.*  
Even if it's just 20 minutes a day, this challenge helps me keep my mind sharp.

## I have already completed Project upto day 10, so will upload all at once, and then continue the other projects.

## 🗂️ Structure
4 folders:
- Beginner : Day 1 to 14
- Intermediate : Day 15 to 58
- Advanced : Day 59 to 81
- Professional Portfolio Project : Day 82 to 100
