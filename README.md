# üêç 100 Days of Python: A Side Quest

This is my personal challenge to consistently improve my Python skills ‚Äî not just by completing tasks but by dedicating time each day to learning, coding, and building.

## üí° What's Different About My Challenge?

Instead of following a strict ‚Äú1 topic per day‚Äù rule, I group tasks based on learning chunks and work through as much as I can depending on how much time I have. Some days I do multiple topics, others I go deep into one.

- üß† The goal is *daily coding*, not just finishing tasks.
- ‚úÖ I track real progress, not artificial deadlines.

## üóìÔ∏è Progress Philosophy

> *Consistency beats perfection.*  
Even if it's just 20 minutes a day, this challenge helps me keep my mind sharp.

## I have already completed Project upto day 10, so will upload all at once, and then continue the other projects.
