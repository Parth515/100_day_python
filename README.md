# 🐍 100 Days of Python: A Side Quest

This is my personal challenge to consistently improve my Python skills — not just by completing tasks but by dedicating time each day to learning, coding, and building.

## 💡 What's Different About My Challenge?

Instead of following a strict “1 topic per day” rule, I group tasks based on learning chunks and work through as much as I can depending on how much time I have. Some days I do multiple topics, others I go deep into one.

- 📚 Some “Day” folders cover multiple challenge topics.
- 🧠 The goal is *daily coding*, not just finishing tasks.
- ✅ I track real progress, not artificial deadlines.

## 🗓️ Progress Philosophy

> *Consistency beats perfection.*  
Even if it's just 20 minutes a day, this challenge helps me keep my mind sharp.
