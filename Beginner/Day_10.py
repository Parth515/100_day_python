# Calculator Project

# Functionality

# Program asks the user to type the first number.
# Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
# Program asks the user to type the second number.
# Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
# Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
# If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
# If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.
# Add the logo from art.py
